        "content": "Hi there! Yellow sunsets can have both scientific and symbolic meanings. Here’s a quick breakdown:\n\nScience (why they happen)\n- The Sun emits white light, which contains all colors.\n- As sunlight passes through the Earth’s atmosphere, shorter wavelengths (blue/violet) scatter out more than longer wavelengths (red/orange).\n- When the Sun is near the horizon, the light travels through a longer path in the atmosphere, so moreblue light is scattered away. The remaining light leans toward red/orange.\n- The exact color you see (yellow, orange, red) depends on atmospheric conditions:\n  - Clean air tends to produce deeper reds.\n  - Dust, smoke, humidity, or pollution can scatter light differently (sometimes giving a yellowish cast).\n  - Clouds can reflect and mix the colors, often softening them to yellow or pinkish hues.\n\nMeaning (interpretation)\n- Physically, a yellow sunset simply shows the particular mix of light and atmospheric conditions at that moment.\n- Symbolically, yellow sunsets are often associated with warmth, calm, and the transition between day and night. Some cultures link yellow to happiness or vitality; others may view it as a warning or caution. Meanings vary by culture and personal experience.\n\nIf you’d like, I can go deeper into the physics, or talk about cultural or artistic interpretations of yellow sunsets, or share tips for photographing them. Which would you prefer?",
