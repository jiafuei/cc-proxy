> I have created a 'user.example.yaml' that represents a configurations for 
  1. Defining custom transformers
  2. Defining custom providers
    2.1 Defining request and response pipelines.
    2.2 Define transformers that will be applied in the pipeline
  3. Defining custom LLM models and its provider
  4. Defining routing configuration
    4.1 The routing keys (default,planning,background) are not user-configurable for now. Only the models used 
  for routing can be configured by the user.

  Create a comprehensive plan in phases, code architecture planning for
  1. Reading the yaml config (It's in ~/.cc-proxy/user.yaml)
  2. Registering custom transformers
  3. Registering custom providers
  4. Registering custom models
  5. Registering routing configuration

  For model routing, create a processor interface in the 'v1/messages' router that
  - accepts incoming ClaudeRequest
  - inspects the request (mock this for now)
  - returns the appropriate pipeline

  @user.example.yaml  
  /ultrathink
  ⎿  Read user.example.yaml (36 lines)

✻ Thinking…

  Let me examine the user.example.yaml file that was just read to understand the configuration structure, and 
  then create a comprehensive plan for implementing this configuration system.

  From the file content, I can see:

  1. Transformers: Custom transformers with names, paths, and arguments
  2. Providers: API providers with configuration including request/response pipelines
  3. Models: Model definitions mapping to providers
  4. Routing: Configuration for different routing scenarios (default, planning, background)

  The user wants a comprehensive plan for:
  1. Reading yaml config from ~/.cc-proxy/user.yaml
  2. Registering custom transformers
  3. Registering custom providers 
  4. Registering custom models
  5. Registering routing configuration
  6. Creating a processor interface in v1/messages router

  Since I'm in plan mode, I need to research the current codebase structure to understand how to integrate this 
  configuration system, then present a comprehensive plan using the ExitPlanMode tool.

  Let me first explore the codebase structure to understand the current architecture.

● I'll analyze the codebase structure and create a comprehensive plan for implementing the YAML configuration
  system. Let me first explore the current project structure to understand the existing architecture.

● List(E:\git\cc-proxy)
  ⎿  Listed 79 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  None of the files appear malicious. I can see a well-structured Python FastAPI project with proper separation 
  of concerns. 

  Now let me examine the key files to understand the current architecture, particularly:
  1. The current config system
  2. The existing transformers
  3. The messages router 
  4. The pipeline services

  Let me read these key files to understand how to integrate the new configuration system.

● Read(app\config\models.py)
  ⎿  Read 85 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(app\routers\messages.py)
  ⎿  Read 71 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(app\services\transformers\__init__.py)
  ⎿  Read 2 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(app\services\pipeline\interfaces.py)
  ⎿  Read 32 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me look at more key files to understand the current architecture better:
  1. Services dependency injection
  2. Pipeline models and services
  3. Current transformer implementations

● Read(app\dependencies\services.py)
  ⎿  Read 54 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(app\services\pipeline\models.py)
  ⎿  Read 75 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(app\services\transformers\anthropic\transformers.py)
  ⎿  Read 53 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now let me examine the pipeline services to understand how requests flow through the system:

● Read(app\services\pipeline\messages_service.py)
  ⎿  Read 70 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

● Read(app\common\utils.py)
  ⎿  Read 18 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Perfect! Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the current architecture. Let me also check the common 
  models to understand ClaudeRequest structure:

● Read(app\common\models.py)
  ⎿  Read 142 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

✻ Thinking…

  Now I have a comprehensive understanding of the current codebase. Let me analyze the user.example.yaml 
  structure again and create a comprehensive plan for implementing the configuration system. 

  Based on my analysis, here's what I understand:

  Current Architecture

  1. Config System: Currently uses app/config/models.py with ConfigModel.load() that loads from 
  ~/.cc-proxy/config.yaml
  2. Dependency Injection: Uses app/dependencies/services.py with a Services class that creates and manages all 
  services
  3. Transformers: Has abstract interfaces in app/services/pipeline/interfaces.py and concrete implementations 
  in app/services/transformers/
  4. Pipeline: Request and response pipelines that apply transformers sequentially
  5. Messages Router: Main router at /v1/messages that uses the pipeline service
  6. Models: ClaudeRequest model represents incoming requests

  User Configuration Requirements

  The user.example.yaml shows they want to configure:

  1. Custom Transformers: Load transformers from Python files with arguments
  2. Custom Providers: Define API endpoints with request/response pipelines 
  3. Custom Models: Map model IDs to providers
  4. Routing Configuration: Route requests to different models based on criteria (default, planning, background)

  Plan Structure

  I need to create a comprehensive plan that:

  1. Phase 1: Configuration Models - Define Pydantic models for user.yaml structure
  2. Phase 2: Dynamic Transformer Loading - Load custom transformers from Python files
  3. Phase 3: Provider Registry - Register custom providers with their pipelines
  4. Phase 4: Model Registry - Map model IDs to providers 
  5. Phase 5: Routing System - Implement request processor that routes based on configuration
  6. Phase 6: Integration - Wire everything together in dependency injection

  Let me create the comprehensive plan now.

● Based on my analysis of the codebase and the user.example.yaml configuration, I'll create a comprehensive plan
   to implement the user configuration system. The current architecture has a solid foundation with dependency
  injection, pipeline services, and transformer interfaces that we can extend.
