- [ ] Dry-run validation mode
- [ ] Configuration examples and templates
- [ ] Built-in transformer catalog (read-only)
- [ ] Interactive configuration generator
- [ ] Comprehensive API documentation

## Phase 8: Security & Policy ðŸ“‹
**Status: Future**

Advanced security and multi-user support.

- [ ] Secure secrets handling
- [ ] Provider URL allowlist
- [ ] TLS certificate hardening
- [ ] Rate limiting per user/key
- [ ] Audit logging
- [ ] Multi-tenant support (if needed)

## Phase 9: Sandbox Capabilities ðŸ“‹
**Status: Future**

Secure plugin execution environment.

- [ ] Run plugins in subprocess with CPU/mem/time caps
- [ ] Process isolation and security boundaries
- [ ] Graceful fallback when plugins fail
- [ ] Resource monitoring and limits
- [ ] Plugin health checks

## Additional Implemented Features

**Features that exist but were not in the original roadmap:**

### Message Processing Extensions
- **Token Counting Endpoint**: `/v1/messages/count_tokens` for request token analysis
- **Streaming Response Conversion**: Non-streaming responses converted to SSE format for consistency
- **Subagent Routing**: Advanced routing capabilities for complex AI workflows

### Generic Transformers (Phase 4 extras)
- **UrlPathTransformer**: Modify provider URLs dynamically
- **AddHeaderTransformer**: Generic header injection
- **AnthropicHeadersTransformer**: Configurable auth header support
- **ClaudeSystemMessageCleanerTransformer**: System message processing
- **RequestBodyTransformer**: JSONPath-based request modification

### Advanced Caching (Phase 2 extras)
- **AnthropicCacheTransformer**: Intelligent cache breakpoint optimization
- **Tool reordering**: Default tools first, MCP tools second
- **Cache breakpoint management**: Up to 4 breakpoints strategically placed

### Configuration Management APIs (Phase 7 extras)
- **Real-time config reload**: `/api/reload` without service restart
- **Config validation**: `/api/config/validate` and `/api/config/validate-yaml`
- **System status**: `/api/config/status` with provider/model counts
